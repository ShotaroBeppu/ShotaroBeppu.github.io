<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> from fall 2024. I like to analyze networks (trade, transportation, and cities with full of exchanges) and historical events for understanding growth.

Prior to this, I worked at <a href="https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment">UChicago Urban Labs</a> studying spatial/environmental economics.

I received a Master of Applied Science in Data, Economics, and Development Policy from <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp">MIT</a> and Bachelor of Engineering from <a href="https://www.si.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">the University of Tokyo</a> in 2023. <br><br><br>

Check <a href="https://www.economicsmentoringprogram.com/">Economics Mentoring Program (EMP)</a> for those interested in an Economics PhD.
