## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in mathematical physics at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) in the group of [Robert Seiringer](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/seiringer-group/).
Prior to this I did my master's degree at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/), 
where I wrote my thesis under supervision of Jan Philip Solovej.

## Research Interests

I am interested in the mathematics of many-body quantum systems. 
More specifically, in my Ph.D. project I study the ground state energy of a dilute spin-polarized Fermi gas.
