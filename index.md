Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at Harvard University (starting fall 2024). I like to analyze networks (trade, transportation, cities with full of exchanges) and historical events.

Prior to this, I worked as an RA at <a href="https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment">UChicago Urban Labs E&E Lab</a>  for 9 months learning spatial/environmental economics.

I received a master's in Applied Science from MIT's <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp">DEDP program</a> and Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Tokyo in 2023.
