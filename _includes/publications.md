Health and macroeconomic outcomes varied substantially across prefectures in Japan during the COVID-19 crisis. Using an estimated macro-epidemiological model as well as the idea of revealed preference, we compute the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) and the conditional trade-off curve between health and economic outcomes in each prefecture. We find that there is a large heterogeneity in the MRS as well as the location and shape of the conditional trade-off curve.

<summary>Abstract</summary>  
International trade and conflicts are key aspects of this world. In particular, weapons are traded across the world and civil wars take place in multiple regions. However, not much is known about how those two are related. This paper combines methods in international trade, network analysis, and literature in both empirical and theoretical conflict to state the importance of this overlooked relationship. This paper uses the shift-share design and network measure derived from the Cournot competition in multiple markets to find significant weapons reallocation to other countries after a ceasefire. This paper then tests insights from a bargaining model with an imperfectly observed claim to illustrate how this exogenous increase in weapons may lead to conflicts. Using the predicted change in weapons due to the reallocation as an instrument, an increase in weapons led to more conflicts. Transparency of weapons trade, however, can counteract this rise in conflict.

*Impact of steamships on maritime network and trade*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
How did technological innovation in steamships affect shipping, trade, and development? The first era of globalization in the 19th century and its relationship with the transition from sailing ships to steamships can provide important historical findings and valuable insights into the age of globalization and technological innovation today. To answer this question, this research first digitized shipping data (Lloyd’s Shipping Index) by applying deep learning methods. With this global data, this research finds mainly four insights related to the advent of steamships. First, the spread of steamships is intertwined with geographic characteristics. Longer distance travel is less likely to use steamships even if it takes less time. Attributes of ports also matter in whether steamships enter rapidly. Second, this research documents port-level changes induced by steamships. Surprisingly, ports likely to benefit more from steamships due to shorter time do not necessarily become essential nor increase their tonnage volumes. Third, countries that experienced a shorter duration than the rest of the world seem to benefit from steamships. Using the exogenous shock due to technological innovation, economic indicators such as GDP and urbanization increased for those with more exposure to steamships. Lastly, this research also finds the divergent effect of steamships. Following the specification used in the third result, steamships hurt colonized countries. This research also provides evidence of the importance of institutions and baseline urbanization for benefiting from this technological change.  </details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
In recent decades the world has seen an increasing number of regional trade agreements in force. Coinciding with increasing tariffs between the US and China, whether this phenomenon promotes protectionism whereby countries trade less with countries outside or functions as a stepping stone for global free trade is a central concern for answering how international trade evolves in the future. This paper gives insight for answering this question by investigating the stability of such regional trading blocs. Inspired by research in the theory of strategic network formation, the model formulated in this paper shows that, contrary to main findings from canonical models, trading blocs are stable in possibly many cases. The results imply that the importance of countries not belonging to trading blocs will increase its importance in the future. Furthermore, changes induced by globalisation do not necessarily lead to global free trade.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
The progress of science increasingly relies on machine learning (ML) and machines work alongside humans in various domains of science. This study investigates the team structure of ML-related projects and analyzes the contribution of ML to scientific knowledge production under different team structure, drawing on bibliometric analyses of 25,000 scientific publications in various disciplines. Our regression analyses suggest that (1) interdisciplinary collaboration between domain scientists and computer scientists as well as the engagement of interdisciplinary individuals who have expertise in both domain and computer sciences are common in ML-related projects; (2) the engagement of interdisciplinary individuals seem more important in achieving high impact and novel discoveries, especially when a project employs computational and domain approaches interdependently; and (3) the contribution of ML and its implication to team structure depend on the depth of ML.
